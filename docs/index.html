        <h2>Navigation patterns in Xamarin.Forms - XAM205</h2>
<p>Part of planning your app's architecture is deciding how the user will move between Pages. Will users need to more forward/backward through a sequence of pages? Does your app have one start page or are there several top-level pages that are all important? Your choice of navigation should work well with your app's content and feel native to each platform you target. This course shows you how to code two common navigation patterns: stack and tab. It includes guidelines to help you decide which pattern is appropriate for your app.  The course also covers how the navigation infrastructure automatically adapts to the runtime platform and shows you how to customize the behavior when needed.</p>
<h3>Upon completion you will be able to:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Move through a sequence of pages using stack navigation</li>
<li>Configure the navigation bar</li>
<li>Display transitory content using modal pages</li>
<li>Switch among a small group of pages using tab navigation</li>
</ul>
